Agenda :

We are excited to invite you to the BasQ Qiskit Fall Fest 2025, happening on November 5th and 6th, featuring activities designed for both newcomers and experienced quantum computing practitioners.

The session, 5th November, will take place from 3:30 PM to 6:00 PM (online) and will begin with a welcome presentation delivered by BasQ.

Following the opening remarks, a thirty-minute introductory talk will be presented, offering a foundational understanding of Qiskit 101. This session will introduce essential concepts such as quantum circuits, services, transpilation processes, and primitives, giving participants the necessary background to engage effectively with the upcoming exercises and challenges.

The next segment will feature an introductory challenge lasting one and a half hours, designed to give attendees hands-on experience with the material covered. Participants will have the opportunity to select a notebook corresponding to their skill level—either intermediate or advanced—allowing them to work at an appropriate level of difficulty. To facilitate this, the registration form will include a question about each participant’s familiarity with Qiskit, ensuring that everyone is placed in a suitable category.

The session will conclude with the presentation of the Hackathon project, titled “Battleship”, which will introduce the main collaborative challenge to be undertaken the following day.

The second session of 6th November will be held in the Faculty of Computer Sciences of EHU located in Donostia, from 15.00 to 18.00. The day will begin with a brief introduction session lasting approximately five minutes.

Following the introduction, there will be a technical quantum talk lasting between 45 minutes. This session will be led by a guest speaker from IBM, who will delve into advanced topics in quantum computing such as Quantum Machine Learning (QML), Dynamical Circuits, and Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD).

After the technical presentation, participants will engage in a two-hour challenge as part of the Hackathon – Battleship. This hands-on session will allow teams to apply the concepts discussed earlier, collaborate on problem-solving tasks, and showcase their creativity and technical skills within the context of the Battleship-themed Hackathon.

The day will conclude with a closing session featuring the award ceremony by Javier Aizpurua, the Scientific Director of BasQ.

The winners of the Hackathon will have the opportunity to visit the new IBM Quantum System Two.
